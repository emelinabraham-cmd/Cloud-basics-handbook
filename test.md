# Cloud vs Edge

## Cloud Computing
- Centralized servers hosted remotely
- Data processed in data centers
- Scalable resources on-demand
- Higher latency, dependent on internet connectivity
- Better for batch processing and storage

## Edge Computing
- Processing happens on local devices or nearby servers
- Reduced latency and faster response times
- Lower bandwidth requirements
- Better for real-time applications
- Improved data privacy and security

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Cloud | Edge |
|--------|-------|------|
| Location | Remote data centers | Local/nearby devices |
| Latency | Higher | Lower |
| Bandwidth | High usage | Reduced |
| Processing | Centralized | Distributed |
| Best for | Storage, ML, scaling | Real-time, IoT |

## When to Use Each
- **Cloud**: Large-scale analytics, machine learning, data storage
- **Edge**: IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, real-time monitoring
